          <h2>Why Monica?</h2>
          <p class="centered-paragraph">Monica is for people who have jobs, a family and are busy trying to find a good work/life balance. So busy, that they don’t have time anymore to remember to call a friend, say happy birthday to a nephew, or remember to invite someone special to come eat dinner next week. The older we get, the more life gets in the way. It’s sad, but it’s just a matter of priorities. I’ve created Monica to help these people.</p>
          <p class="centered-paragraph">Monica is not for everyone. It’s probably not targeted at people who see their friends every day and have a super busy social life.</p>
          <p class="centered-paragraph">Monica is not a social network. <strong>It's not Facebook</strong>. It's for your eyes only.</p>
