          <h3>People suffering from Alzheimer's</h3>
          <p>Alzheimer's is a terrible disease, characterized by memory loss. Because Monica lets you record everything about the people you love, people with Alzheimer are able to keep a record of who's who, and what they've done with them.</p>

        <div class="col-4">
          <h3>People with very busy lives</h3>
          <p>Like most, these people care a lot about their loved ones but are so busy that they often forget important events and details. Monica helps to mitigate this by acting as a central repository for this information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
          <h3>People with Asperger syndrome</h3>
          <p>Asperger syndrom is a subtype of autism, that amongst other things, affects social interactions. Monica helps people with Aspergers to track and maintain relationships with the ones they love.</p>

          <h2>Why Monica?</h2>
          <p class="centered-paragraph">Monica is for people who have jobs, a family, and are busy trying to find a good work/life balance. So busy, that they don’t have time anymore to remember to call a friend, say happy birthday to a nephew, or remember to invite someone special for dinner next week. The older we get the more life gets in the way. It’s sad, but it’s the reality. I created Monica to help these people.</p>
          <p class="centered-paragraph">Monica is not for everyone. It’s probably not targeted at people who see their friends every day and have an incredibly busy social life.</p>
          <p class="centered-paragraph">Monica is not a social network. <strong>It's not Facebook</strong>. It's for your eyes only.</p>
